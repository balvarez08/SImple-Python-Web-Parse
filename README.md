# SImple-Python-Web-Parse
Simple PY script that parses data from a specific web page

This is basically a "hello world" on using `urllib` library. I used it to parse a website to get a list of songs for our wedding since I wasn't able to copy it directly from the webpage.
We wanted to put the song list on an excel so that we can easily pick songs we like.


Note: I can't run the script anymore locally since my IP is now blocked by the host :)
